## kgfbarbosa's DSP Learning Archive

This repository is a **personal, academic, and professional** archive that brings together code, projects, and notes developed by me as part of my continuous learning and practice with **DSPs (Digital Signal Processing)**.

---

## Objectives

The goals of this repository are:

- To document my journey in studying and using DSPs;  
- To consolidate a personal technical reference base;  
- To structure projects with clear and reusable documentation;  
- To share experiences under an open license;  
- To showcase my technical proficiency for academic and professional purposes.

This repository includes:

- Concept and functionality tests;  
- Complete or in-progress projects;  
- Sketches, experiments, and implementations based on tutorials.

> **Note:** This repository is a collection of studies with an educational and exploratory focus — not for commercial use. The code may not be finalized or optimized for production.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Language:** C, Embedded C;  
- **Tools:** Code Composer Studio (CCS) v12.8.1, ControlSUITE v4.2.0;  
- **Boards used:** Texas Instruments TMS320F28379D (C2000 Delfino DSP).

## Repository Structure

The structure may evolve over time as I add new tests or reorganize files. Generally, it is organized by the semesters during which I worked on the repo, with folders for each project or experiment (including code, constraints, simulations, and notes when necessary).

The repository also includes the `README` and `LICENSE` files.

## Usage and Reference

Regarding this repository, you are free to:

- Study the code and materials I created;  
- Use them as a basis for learning or analysis;  
- Adapt them for personal use;  
- Reference them in technical and scientific materials — but only as a supporting source alongside more authoritative references like books and peer-reviewed articles.

However, if you use any part of this repository in your own projects or publications, I kindly ask that you give proper credit by citing this repository as a source. Attribution is always appreciated.
